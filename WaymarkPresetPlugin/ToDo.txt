High Priority:

- Nothing for now.


Low Priority:

- Probably throttle checking the content finder link type in the future so that UI rendering doesn't call into the game a trillion times a second.
- Look into clearing out newlines when a user tries to paste something from the PP settings file before it actually goes into the text box.  From Wintermute: "You may be able to 'intercept' the paste and strip linebreaks on it before it actually goes in your textbox, Doesn't imgui support something like it, I thought it did".
- See if it's not too difficult to let a user just paste the entire PP settings file and/or a path to it and import from that.
- Switch preset import text box to be one with a hint if that ever gets fixed in the C# ImGui bindings.
- Make the preset info use a monospace font for coordinate alignment.


New Functionality:

- Consider having a drawing of marks around their barycenter in the editor window.
- Add a button to directly save current waymarks?  Requires finding current zone and current waymark data.  Maybe try to find function that gets called when saving a preset instead?
